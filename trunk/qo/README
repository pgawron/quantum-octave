General information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
QuantumOctave is a set of GNU Octave functions for doing quick-and-dirty simulations of quantum 
computers and -- in general -- quantum systems. Our ambition is implementation of complete set 
of function needed for performing quantum computation.

You can download the package from the project home page.

	http://quantum-octave.sf.net/ 

or using SourceForge SVN service.

Instalation
^^^^^^^^^^^
To use quantum-octave you need GNU Octave in version higher then 2.1.35. You can download it for

	http://www.octave.org/
	
or, if you using Linux, install binary version which ships with your distribution.
	
Ungzip and untar with m-files and add directory quantum-octave to OCTAVE_PATH environment variable. 
Users of bash compatible shell should type

	export OCTAVE_PATH=$OCTAVE_PATH:/path/to/quantum-octave:/path/to/quantum-octave/examples

Package was tested with GNU Ocatve versions 3.1 and some function may not work
with older version of GNU Octave.
